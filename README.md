# ReactAnimatedInput
It is a simple component that animated the placeholder upon selection. 

# Typical Usage

It is identical basically to using a text input but it handles alot of the wrapping already. The styles are very easy to
modify. The props you pass in should just be related to the text input. 

```
< AnimatedInput placeholder="Username" type="text" onChange={this.someFunction} 
value={this.state.inputVal}/>

```
